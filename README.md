## 💡 Purpose of the Project
The purpose of Unit Nova is to revolutionize the way players and developers interact with the Roblox platform by introducing an intelligent, command-driven companion system. It empowers users to take control of their game worlds through bots that are not only responsive but also adaptable to nearly any task, role, or function the player envisions.

In traditional Roblox games, automation and AI behavior are often limited to pre-defined NPCs with fixed behaviors. Unit Nova breaks that mold by offering a modular, extensible framework where bots can interpret a wide variety of commands typed by the player or scripted into the environment. These bots act as companions, assistants, workers, guards, or even builders — all under your direct command.

At its core, Unit Nova is about player freedom and interaction. It provides a way for users to shape their experience actively rather than passively play through scripted events. Want a bot to build a house for you? Done. Need a guard to protect a location while you explore? Just say the word. Need help collecting resources across a massive map? Your bot is ready.

For developers, Unit Nova serves as a powerful foundation system that can be implemented in a variety of genres:

🏰 Roleplaying Games – where bots act as companions, soldiers, or NPC allies.

⚒️ Automation Simulators – where bots perform resource gathering, crafting, or repetitive tasks.

⚔️ Combat and Strategy Games – where bots fight alongside players or execute squad commands.

🌍 Sandbox and Open-World Games – where bots enhance exploration, construction, or world interaction.

The system is designed with expandability in mind. It uses a clean, well-documented Lua structure that allows developers to add new command types, behaviors, and visual styles with minimal effort. Everything is designed to plug in easily — whether you want bots that fly, teleport, dig tunnels, or build castles, Unit Nova provides the command architecture to make it happen.

It is also multiplayer-aware, meaning each player can control their own bot(s) without conflicts or shared memory issues. Bots can dynamically identify their owners and act only on that player’s commands, making it ideal for team games, co-op adventures, or persistent-world projects.

But most importantly, Unit Nova is about imagination. It’s a system that hands creative power back to the player. You define the action. You give the command. The world responds.
